#### Practice post by Ellie
For **my midterm project,** I explored the chapter of Maïssa Bey’s 2006 novel *Bleu blanc vert* in which Lilas takes walks around Algiers, during a period in which she is feeling trapped within gender roles, her marriage, and her apartment. This chapter (the first of the novel’s third section) differs greatly from the chapters surrounding it; for example, in Ali’s chapter immediately following it, he notes that Lilas pairs her long walks with obsessive reading in her room (195). Lilas’s subsequent chapter highlights her feeling of hopelessness; she describes herself as “Prisonnière d’un filet que l’on a tissé soi-même” (197). This chapter of walks, then, in which she both moves and speaks freely and confidently, deserves heightened attention.
