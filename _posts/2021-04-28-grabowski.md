#### Introduction: Why Map a Novel?   
Maïssa Bey’s 2006 novel *Bleu blanc vert* is an account of two young people, Ali and Lilas, in Algiers from 1962 to 1992, revolving around their lives in one apartment building in the Belouizdad (formerly Belcourt) area of Algiers. It is inherently spatial: the events of the plot are inseparable from the space in which they occur, be that space public or private. Bey peppers the narration of both of her two main characters with references to real places, both historical and contemporary, throughout the city. Sometimes the names are specific, sometimes general; sometimes the places are still locatable today, sometimes not. What’s more, some places that are central to the novel are not given a real-life referent, such as the very apartment building where the majority of the novel takes place. What patterns underlie the use of place names in the novel, and what do they reveal about Ali’s and Lilas’s relationships to space and to postcolonial Algiers? These questions form the basis of my mapping project of *Bleu blanc vert*. In this project, I will use several different maps of the novel to argue that its use of space reflects not only the main characters’ gendered relationship with space, but also with history and with the city itself.  
A novel and a map could seem at first glance to have little in common. One is fictional, whereas one is presented as being “real”; one is usually made up of words, another usually of images; et cetera. Nonetheless, the two can and have been brought together. Franco Moretti argues that maps can serve as a tool for recognizing patterns that can then be analyzed (53-54). For Moretti, these patterns, or “relations,” are the crucial point: “Locations *as such* did not seem that significant, if compared to the *relations* that the map had revealed among them… if I keep making diagrams, then, it is because for me *geometry ‘signifies’ more than geography*… It is a sign that something is at work here—that something has *made* the pattern the way it is” (55-56, emphasis in original). It would seem, then, that the maps or “diagrams” that Moretti makes are distinct from so-called “regular” maps, since in the latter, the geography, not the geometry, is what is significant. This, then, is one approach to mapping a novel. Another one can be found in the idea of “surface reading” put forth by Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus. Best and Marcus define the “surface” of a text as “what is evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts; what is neither hidden nor hiding; what, in the geometrical sense, has length and breadth but no thickness, and therefore covers no depth. A surface is what insists on being looked *at* rather than what we must train ourselves to see *through*” (9, emphasis in original). Taken out of context in this way, this definition could just as easily apply to a map as to a text.  
In the case of *Bleu blanc vert*, one of the things that might be said to be its surface, “what insists on being looked *at*,” is the city of Algiers. Unlike Best and Marcus’s definition, however, Algiers also “insists on being looked *at…through*” time. The novel gives the shifting landscape of postcolonial Algiers a central role, as place names change along with society, and tracks these changes across time. According to Henry Grabar, postcolonial Algiers can be thought of as a “palimpsest: the traces of history shine through even the most determined transformations. Each of the major efforts at appropriating French space remains tangled with colonial meaning, and validates the city as a complex and undervalued document of post-colonial national identity” (Grabar 391). Grabar’s use of the terms “palimpsest” and “document” to speak of primarily visual and spatial urban phenomena is revealing: the spaces of the city can be read like a text. In other words, when it comes to Algiers and *Bleu blanc vert*, the “surface” and the “depth” are one and the same (Best and Marcus 9). The consequence of this context is that my project of mapping the locations mentioned in *Bleu blanc vert*, while in one sense an attempt at surface reading and mapping, is in another sense a deeply *close* reading. The maps reveal how Ali and Lilas experience public space differently over the course of their lives, making for a curious kind of split bildungsroman and revealing the effects of gender on Lilas’s relationship with space, and vice versa, as a young woman. Therefore, if we read the use of real places through Algiers in the novel as a foregrounding of history, the maps illustrate not only Lilas and Ali’s different movements as a young woman and a young man, but also their different relationships with history and Algeria itself. To demonstrate this, I will first discuss what the maps of the novel reveal about the role of gender as a mediator with public space and then move on to discuss the ways in which the novel emphasizes the ways in which the map and the text are like each other.

#### A Gendered Bildungsroman  
*Bleu blanc vert* tells both Ali and Lilas’s stories as they grow up over the course of thirty years. Beginning as young children and ending when they are married adults with a daughter of their own, and told in alternating chapters from Ali’s and Lilas’s points of view, the novel has in this sense a very traditional structure: that of the coming-of-age story or bildungsroman. In this section, I will compare maps the places that Ali and Lilas mention in each part of the novel. Each part spans ten years, with the first stretching from 1962 to 1972, the second from 1972 to 1982, and the third from 1982 to 1992.  
Maps 1 and 2 show the locations mentioned by Ali and Lilas in Part One, and though they broadly share a concentration in the central areas of Algiers, they also differ from each other in several ways.

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
